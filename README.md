# Excluding Periods
Algorithm to exclude possible orbital periods of the ringed substellar companion J1407b with long-baseline photometry.

This is a script to exclude possible orbital periods of the ringed companion of the the young star J1407 using photometry with a long baseline. A detailed description can be found in Mentel et. al. (2018, in preparation).

To obtain the exact results detailed in the aforementioned paper, one would need to run the script with the complete data set. Obviously, I could not upload the complete data set here. Instead, I provided the publicly available AAVSO data on J1407, covering the star's photometry from 2012 to November of 2017, in order to show the principle modus operandi of the script. Running the .py-file will yield exemplary results of the PFA for test periods between 1 and 10 years.
