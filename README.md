# Excluding Periods
Algorithm to exclude possible orbital periods of the ringed substellar companion J1407b

This is a script to exclude possible orbital periods of the ringed companion of the the young star J1407. A detailed description can be found in Kenworthy and Mentel et. al. (2017, in preparation).

To obtain the exact results detailed in the aforementioned paper, one would need to run the script with the complete data set as detailed in the paper. Obviously, I could not upload the complete data set here. Instead, I uploaded the AAVSO data on J1407 (covering 2012 to November of 2017), which is publicly available. Thus, the principle modus operandi of the script can be comprehended.

Running the .py-file will yield exemplary results of the PFA for test periods between 1 and 10 years.
